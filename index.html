          explained that, "unlike real paper, our digital material can expand
          and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges.
          Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch." Google
          states that their new design language is based on paper and ink but
          implementation takes place in an advanced manner.

        <p>
          In 2018, Google detailed a revamp of the language, with a focus on
          providing more flexibility for designers to create custom "themes"
          with varying geometry, colors, and typography. In 2021, a further
          evolution of the design language, titled Material You, was unveiled.

          Material Design was to be gradually extended throughout Google's array
          of web and mobile products, providing a consistent experience across

        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <h3>Material Design 2</h3>
        <p>
          After the 2018 revamp, Google began redesigning most of their apps
          based on an updated set of principles and guidelines dubbed "Material
          Design 2", which provided a larger focus on customization of the basic
          Material Design components to adapt to the branding of the products in
          which it is being used. The updated guidelines further heavily
          emphasizes white space, rounded corners, colorful icons, and bottom
          navigation bars. Google began utilizing a special size-optimized
          version of their proprietary

          known as "Material You" (also known as "Material Design 3"),
          emphasizing increased animation, larger buttons, and the ability for
          custom UI themes to be generated from the user's wallpaper. Material
